As the legal custodian of the protocol and the owner of the Cardano brand, the Foundation works to drive adoption and partnerships, grow the Cardano community globally, shape legislation and commercial standards, and ensure stakeholder accountability at every level.

The Foundation’s most crucial responsibility is driving platform adoption and supporting the diverse Cardano community – people like you – engaging with and implementing ideas on the Cardano platform. To fulfil this caretaking role to the highest standards, the Cardano Foundation has a governing Council, a professional executive team and community managers, recruited in many cases directly from the wider Cardano community.

However, their focus is as outward-looking as it is inward. The Foundation is equally committed to working with other key industries within the blockchain realm, contributing to the advancement of the technology and driving adoption with other compatible systems. The Foundation contributes to the conversation and perception of blockchain globally, focusing on legal frameworks, integration with legacy systems and third-parties, awareness, and education – to ensure that blockchain technology can be accessed and understood by all.
