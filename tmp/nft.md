A unique asset that is not interchangeable with any other asset(s). 
Non-fungible assets represent specific information (IP rights for example), and act as one unit that cannot be divided into smaller fractions. Non-fungible tokens have unique attributes; they are usually linked to a specific asset. They can be used to prove the ownership of digital items like game skins right through to the ownership of physical assets.

Other tokens are fungible, in the same way as coins or banknotes. Fungible tokens are identical, they have the same attributes and value when exchanged.
