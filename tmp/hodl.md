## ***It all started as a drunken rant*** ðŸ¥ƒ 

Back in December of 2013, Bitcoin was on another huge upwards swing, from November to early December the price of BTC rose from around $250 USD all the way up to $1,151 USD. This massive 300x move to the upside led many to take to the ***[Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php)*** to discuss various trading strategies. 

 One user by the name of "GameKyuubi" posted a drunken thread about their particular trading strategy with a topic title reading "[I AM HODLING](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)". This drunken typo filled post gave birth to the most well know Bitcoin trading strategy today HODL, which means to never trade your Bitcoin based on day-to-day action in the crypto markets.
