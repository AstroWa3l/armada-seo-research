Using the Wallet, you can easily setup the device, manage your cryptocurrency assets, initiate transfers to other services or friends, and more.

It is the official production-level, battle-tested version of the web-wallet interface. It is feature-conservative, meaning new functions are added at a slower pace and only after they are thoroughly tested. The purpose of this wallet is to provide a stable and uninterrupted access to Trezor functions.
